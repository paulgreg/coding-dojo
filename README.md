# Base project to begin coding dojo

That project is a minimal project to begin a coding dojo in JavaScript, especially the [Roman Numerals](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/romannumerals-kata.html) one.

It uses karma (launcher), jasmine (test framework), chai (assertions lib) and phantomJS (test runner).

## To “play”

   - `npm install`
   - `npm test` to launch karma in TDD mode (no-single-run)
   - `npm start` to launch karma in single run mode
